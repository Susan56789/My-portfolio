## React vs Angular

Choosing the proper javascript frameworks could be a real confusion. particularly once you have heaps of choices that are super capable and capable of facilitating the project requirements. however selecting the one for the right set of comes demands data of many crucial aspects. we've coated a number of the essential points during this post by creating a good comparison of Angular vs React.

### What is Angular ?

Angular, developed by Google, was first released in 2010, making it the oldest of the lot. It is a TypeScript-based JavaScript framework. A substantial shift occurred in 2016 on the release of Angular 2 (and the dropping of the “JS” from the original name – AngularJS). Angular 2+ is known as just Angular. Although AngularJS (version 1) still gets updates, we will focus the discussion on Angular. The latest stable version is Angular 13, which was released in November 2021.

Angular is a development platform built on the typescript. It is a component-based framework for building scalable web apps. It has a collection of well-integrated libraries and features such as client-server communication, routing, and more. It has a suite of developer tools to develop and scale projects from single-developer size to enterprise-grade applications. Moreover, it’s constantly updated technology with its latest developments led by the Angular team at Google.

### What is React ?

React, developed by Facebook, was initially released in 2013. Facebook uses React extensively in their products (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp). The current stable version is 17.X, released in October 2020 (with smaller incremental updates since then).

React is an open-source JavaScript library used for frontend development. it's used for building program or UI components. Its component-based and declarative traits let developers produce interactive and sophisticated UIs easily. Developers will build quick and scalable apps for all platforms because of its “learn once write anywhere” principle. React is managed by Facebook and a community of individual developers and communities.

### Angular vs React Comparison

Angular is a structural framework for developing dynamic web apps, whereas React is a javascript library that allows you to build UI components.
Angular is based on MVC (Model View Controller) whereas React is based on Virtual DOM.
Angular is based on Typescript and React is based on Javascript.
Angular doesn’t provide adding javascript library to the source code while React allows adding javascript library to the source code.
Angular provides testing and debugging for a complete project with a single tool whereas React requires a set of tools to perform different types of testing.

### Key Features of React

#### 1. Virtual DOM

This characteristic of React helps to speed up the app development process and offers flexibility. The algorithm facilitates the replication of a web page in React’s virtual memory.

The original DOM is thereby represented by a virtual DOM.

Whenever the app is modified or updated, the entire UI is rendered again by the virtual DOM, by updating the components that have been modified. This reduces the time and cost taken for development.

#### 2. JavaScript XML or JSX

It is a markup syntax that describes the appearance of the interface of the app. It makes the syntax just like HTML and is used to create React components by developers.

JSX is one of the best features of React JS as it makes it super easy for developers to write the building blocks.

#### 3. React Native

Uses native, rather than web components to facilitate native React JS development for Android and iOS.

Basically, this feature transforms React code to render it compatible with iOS or Android platforms and provides access to their native features.

#### 4. One-Way Data Binding

This means that React uses a flow of data that is unidirectional, forcing developers to use the callback feature to edit components, and preventing them from editing them directly.

The controlling of data flow from a single point is achieved with a JS app architecture component called Flux. It actually affords developers better control over the app and makes it more flexible and effective.

#### 5. Declarative UI

This feature makes React code more readable and easier to fix bugs. React JS is the best platform to develop UIs that are both exciting and engaging not just for web apps, but mobile apps as well.

#### 6.Component Based Architecture

This simply means that the user interface of an app based on React JS is made up of several components, with each of them having its particular logic, written in JS.

Due to this, developers can relay the data across the app without the DOM being impacted. React JS components play a huge part in deciding the app visuals and interactions.

### Key Features of Angular

#### 1. Cross-Platform

With Angular, you can develop progressive web applications (PWA). PWA offers an app-like experience to the audience using modern web capabilities. As per your needs, you can deploy an app as native as well as progressive. The hybrid mobile SDK called Ionic can ship your apps to the app store and deploy the same to the mobile web as PWA.

In addition, you can develop apps for the desktop with Angular

#### 2. High Speed & Optimum Performance

Angular redefines the modern JavaScript virtual machine by turning templates into code. Thus, your hand-written code can leverage on a productive framework. The best thing about Angular is that you can render the code into HTML & CSS and have the first view of the application on any other platform like NodeJS, .Net, PHP, etc.

The loading time of Angular apps is faster than any other front end framework in the industry. It loads in the speed of Cheetah with any new component router. Further, the code gets split automatically as per user’s loading and rendering requirements.

#### 3. Efficient Two-Way Data Binding

The most effective Angular feature is its two-way data binding system. The View layer exactly represents the Model layer and they stay in perfect synchronization. If you make any change in the model, the users can see in the view model automatically. Thus, it decreases important development time.

#### 4. Virtual Scrolling

Angular Virtual Scrolling helps the code react to various scroll events. Besides loading and unloading visible DOM elements, Virtual Scrolling enables an effective way for items simulation.

#### 5. TypeScript

With TypeScript, Angular offers a seamless experience to the developers. And TypeScript is the top choice for frontend development since 2019. It is highly efficient in detecting bugs and thereby, reduces developing time. TypeScript also automatically populates the root file configuration for easy compilation. In comparison to JavaScript, TypeScript has richer enums, interfaces, generics, hybrid types, union/intersection types, access modifiers, etc.
