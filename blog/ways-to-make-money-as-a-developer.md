### 4. Coach, mentor, or create a community for other developers

If you have experience in your field, you can offer mentoring, coaching, and community to other developers who are in the same field and faced with the same obstacles that you have overcome.   You could go the classic consulting and training route like Eliot Sykes, an open source developer and  contributor who trains Rails developers. Or, like John Sonmez of Simple Programmer, you could offer life coaching to other developers.
If you don't have  time to find consulting clients or offer one-on-one advice, but still want to connect with other developers, consider creating a membership page.   There are many different types of membership sites, but the general idea is to create a subscription that offers its members something of value, such as: B. Exclusive content, early access to products, or a community of developers with similar goals.   Justin Jackson does just that with the MegaMaker Club, a "private community for geeks who do things".

Selling information products is a great way to make money, and e-books are one of the most popular information products out there.  The global e-book market is projected to reach nearly $ 18 billion in annual sales by 2025.  You don't have to sell Kindle e-books on Amazon to participate in this growth. In fact, you can make even more money  selling e-books on your own website.  You don't have a page yet or are you looking for a new one?

### 6. Sell online courses

Online courses are another great  passive income option (mostly) for developers who want to share their knowledge with others. Once you create your  course online, all you have to do is advertise your course to potential students.  As with e-books, the market for online learning is growing rapidly. The e-learning market is projected to grow 8% annually, reaching a whopping $ 375 billion by 2026.  To outline your online course, start with the end result that your learners want  to achieve, then create a step-by-step step-by-step plan to achieve that result. Each of these steps is a lesson or module in your online course.  online courses are also a great way to reuse content you've created. If you know enough about a subject to write an e-book or make a video about it, you probably know enough to create, teach, and sell a course.
